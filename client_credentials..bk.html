<p>The previous topic [node:3972] demonstrates how to configure simple API key validation. In this topic, you enhance API key-based security by configuring OAuth client credentials to provide authorization for APIs.</p>

<p>OAuth is an authorization protocol. It is slightly different from typical access control mechanism in that the focus of OAuth is enabling app end users to authorize apps to access APIs on their behalf. Apps do so by obtaining 'access tokens'. OAuth access tokens have been compared to 'valet keys'. A valet key is a car key that only unlocks doors and starts the car. A valet key cannot be used to open the trunk or the glove compartment. Thus, access tokens enforce a limited capabilities model of security. An access token can, for example, provide an app with the ability to access an end user's account to read a checking account balance, but not to issue an electronic funds transfer.</p>

<p>OAuth access tokens is that they can be long-lived, or easily refreshed. This enables apps to access data on behalf of end users repeatedly, without requiring the app end user to login each time. Access tokens can also be revoked by the end user or the provider whenever necessary, providing an extra level of accountability.</p>

<p>OAuth defines different ways of creating access tokens that apps can use to access protected APIs. The various mechanisms for distributing access tokens are referred to as 'grant types'. In this topic, you configure the most basic grant type defined by the OAuth specification: 'client credentials'.</p>

<h2>Client credentials grant type</h2>
<p>The client credentials grant type defines a flow in which access tokens are distributed in exchange for 'client credentials'. Client credentials consist of a consumer key and secret pair. (These credentials are sometimes also called "API key and secret" or "app key and secret". The terms are interchangeable and refer to the same credentials.) In other words the client credentials grant type makes it easy for apps to obtain access tokens using common consumer key and secret pairs.</p>
	
<p>For this reason, it is relatively simple to 'step up' from API key validation to OAuth by using the client credentials grant type. You can use the consumer key and secret generated for your app in [node:427] to retrieve access tokens from the endpoint you configure in this topic.</p>

<p>The full specification for the client credentials grant can be found in the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-1.3.4">OAuth 2.0 Specification</a>. </p>

<h2>Default OAuth client credentials endpoints</h2>

<p>Apigee provides free, out-of-the-box OAuth token endpoints that support the client credentials grant type.</p>

<p>Each organization (even a free trial org) on the API Platform is provisioned with OAuth access token and refresh token endpoints. You can begin using them as soon as your organization has been setup.</p>

<p>The default endpoints expose the following endpoint URIs:</p>

<ul><li><code>/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</code>: Publish this URI to developers who need to obtain access tokens</li>
 
<li><code>/oauth/client_credential/refresh_accesstoken</code>: Publish this URI to developers who need to refresh access tokens</li></ul>

<p>These endpoints are exposed over the network by the following URLs:</p>

<pre>https://{org_name}-{env_name}.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</pre>

<pre>https://{org_name}-{env_name}.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/refresh_accesstoken</pre>

<div class="tipstricks"><p>By default, out-of-the-box OAuth endpoints are only deployed in the test environment. Before they are available in prod, you must explicitly deploy the API proxy called <code>oauth</code> to <code>prod</code>.</p></div>

<p>For example, if your organization name is "apimakers", the token and refresh endpoint URLs would be:</p>

<pre>https://apimakers-test.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</pre>

<pre>https://apimakers-test.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/refresh_accesstoken</pre>

<h2>Retrieving an access token</h2>

<h2>Securing an API</h2>


<p>Setting up OAuth client credentials is a two-step procedure:</p>

<ol><li>Configure a token endpoint</li>
<li>Apply policies to protected resources</li></ol>

<h2>Configure a Token Endpoint</h2>

<p>A token endpoint distributes access tokens to apps that present valid cli  ent credential. "Valid credentials" consist of a consumer key and secret pair. The token endpoint verifies that the consumer key and secret are approved and have not been revoked.</p>

<p>To set up a token endpoint, configure a policy of type <code>OAuthV2</code> that specifies the <code>GenerateAccessToken</code> operation.</p>

<p>This policy configures the behavior of the token endpoint, which will distribute OAuth 2.0 access tokens to apps that present valid credentials. The policy is configured in a file called <code>GenerateAccessToken.xml</code>with the following content:</p>

	<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="GenerateAccessToken"&gt;
  &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
  &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;3600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;
  &lt;SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;client_credentials&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;/SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;request.queryparam.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<h2>Apply policies to protected resources</h2>

<h3>ValidateOAuth policy of type OAuthV2</h3>

<p>Once access tokens are issued to apps, the apps can in turn use the access tokens to make calls to 'protected resources'. You can protect an API resource by applying an OAuthV2 policy that defines the VerifyAccessToken operation.</p>

<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="ValidateOAuth"&gt; 
  &lt;Operation&gt;VerifyAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt; 
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<h2>Attaching policies to the ProxyEndpoint</h2>

<p>You have now configured two policies. One policy defines a token endpoint. The other policy defines a protected resource. Now you need to attach the policies as processing Steps to appropriate Flows in the API proxy configuration.</p>

<p>An OAuth configuration requires at least two conditional Flows to be configured, one for the token endpoint and another for the protected resource(s). Each Flow defines a URI path. One  path defines the URI used by apps to obtain access tokens. The other URI(s) define the resources that you need to protect.</p>

<p>These URIs and policy attachments can be defined in the API proxy, or in different API proxies. For example, you may wish to consolidate OAuth-related policies in a single, dedicated API proxy that only serves as a token distribution endpoint. For simplicity, here you include both the token endpoint URI and the protected resource URI in the same API proxy configuration.</p>

<p>A token endpoint is simply a URI fragment to which an OAuthV2 policy attached. Such a condition can be defined as follows:</p>

<pre>&lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/accesstoken"&lt;/Condition&gt;</pre>

<p>By configuring this Condition, you create a URI that apps can use to retrieve access tokens.</p>

<p>To create a Flow that executes the OAuthV2 policy, and thus acts as a token endpoint, create a Flow like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;Flow name="TokenEndpoint"&gt;
   &lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/accesstoken"&lt;/Condition&gt;
   &lt;Request&gt;
     &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
   &lt;/Request&gt;
 &lt;/Flow&gt;</pre>

<p>The full path to the token endpoint is the virtual host, the ProxyEndpoint base path, and a 'suffix', this case, <code>/accesstoken</code>.</p>

<pre>{virtual_host}/{base_path}/accesstoken</pre>

<p>Therefore, to request an access token, an app makes a request to, for example:</p>

<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/accesstoken</pre>

<p>You now have a URL that you can share with app developers building OAuth-enabled apps.</p>

<p>To enforce access tokens for authorization to protected resources, create a named Flow with no condition. Since no condition is specified, the Flow will execute for every request that does not suffix <code>/accesstoken</code>. In other words, it acts as a 'default' Flow. Apps first call /accesstoken, and once they possess an access token, they call the URL for the protected resource.</p>

<pre>&lt;Flow name="Authorize"&gt;
  &lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;ValidateOAuth&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;/Request&gt;
&lt;/Flow&gt;</pre>

<p>In the simpleProxy, configure the ProxyEndpoint named default <code>/proxies/default.xml</code> as follows:</p>

	<pre>&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
  &lt;Flows&gt;
    &lt;Flow name="TokenEndpoint"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Apps call this URI to present credentials and obtain an access token --&gt;
      &lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix MatchesPath "/accesstoken"&lt;/Condition&gt;
      &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
      &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;/Flow&gt;
    &lt;Flow name="Authorize"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Validates access tokens before authorizing access --&gt;
      &lt;Request&gt;
        &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;ValidateOAuth&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
      &lt;/Request&gt;
    &lt;/Flow&gt;
  &lt;/Flows&gt;
  &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
    &lt;BasePath&gt;/weather&lt;/BasePath&gt;
    &lt;VirtualHost&gt;default&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
  &lt;/HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
  &lt;RouteRule name="default"&gt;
    &lt;TargetEndpoint&gt;default&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
  &lt;/RouteRule&gt;
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;</pre>

<h2>Importing and deploying</h2>

<h2>Obtaining a access token and invoking a protected resource</h2>

<p>An app obtains an access token by making a request to the token endpoint with valid credentials. Since you configured the client credentials grant type, an app can obtain an access token using only valid consumer key and secret pair.</p>

<p>First, use the Platform API to retrieve the consumer key and secret for the app created in [node:427]:</p>

<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{myorg}/developers/{developer_email}/apps/{app_name}</pre>

<h4>For example, an app profile for weatherapp</h4>

	<pre>{
  "accessType" : "read",
  "appFamily" : "default",
  "attributes" : [ {
    "name" : "Platform",
    "value" : "iOS"
  } ],
  "callbackUrl" : "login.weatherapp.com",
  "createdAt" : 1349462499114,
  "createdBy" : "ntesla@theramin.com",
  "credentials" : [ {
    "apiProducts" : [ {
      "apiproduct" : "weather_free",
      "status" : "approved"
    } ],
    "attributes" : [ ],
    "consumerKey" : "bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpVKNhGar6K",
    "consumerSecret" : "hAr4Gn0gA9vAyvI4",
    "scopes" : [ ],
    "status" : "approved"
  } ],
  "developerId" : "myorg@@@6E2W6HKAFsJhqAb9",
  "lastModifiedAt" : 1349462499114,
  "lastModifiedBy" : "admin@apigee.com",
  "name" : "weatherapp",
  "status" : "approved"
}</pre>

<p>Note the consumer key and consumer secret values. The consumer key and secret are presented to the token endpoint as 'Basic Authentication' credentials as follows. The request must also specify the grant type, in this case client credentials. The grant type is presented as a query parameter to the request:</p>

<pre>$ curl -u bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpVKNhGar6K:hAr4Gn0gA9vAyvI4 http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/accesstoken?grant_type=client_credentials</pre>

<p>The API Platform verifies the consumer key and secret and then generates a response containing the access token for this app:</p>

	<pre>{
"issued_at":1349466897628,
"scope":"",
"application_name":"weatherapp",
"status":"approved",
"organization_id":0,
"state":"null",
"expires_in":1799,
"api_profile_name":"null",
"refresh_token":"null",
"access_token":"OqX8UUlT98XAKsBbTYHpEt5tkiCV",
"refresh_count":0
}</pre>

<p>Note the <code>access_token</code> value in the response above. This is the access token that the app will use to gain runtime access to protected resources.</p>
	
<p>The access token is included in the request as an "Authorization" HTTP header as follows: </p>

<pre>curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OqX8UUlT98XAKsBbTYHpEt5tkiCV" http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

<p>The API Platform validates that the access token presented is valid for the API product, and then grants access,  returning the Weather report.</p>
