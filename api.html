<p>[toc]</p>

<p>Every organization has a unique software development lifecycle (SDLC). It is often necessary to synchronize and align API proxy deployment with the processes used for backend services. </p>
	
<p>The Platform API methods demonstrated in this topic can be used to integrate API proxy management into your organization's SDLC. A common usage of this API is to write scripts or code that deploy API proxies, or that migrate API proxies from one environment to another, as part of a larger automated process that also deploys or migrates other applications.</p>

<p>The Platform API makes no assumptions about your SDLC (or anyone else's, for that matter). Rather, it exposes atomic functions that can be coordinated by your development team to automate and optimize your API development lifecycle.</p>

<p>All of the API Platform APIs are documented in [node:4972]. This topic focuses on the set of APIs that are for managing API proxies.</p>

<h2>Interacting with the API</h2>

The following steps walk you through simple interactions with the APIs.

<h3>List APIs in your organization</h3>

<p>You can begin by listing all of the API proxies in your organization. (Remember to substitute entries for <code>myname:mypass</code> and <code>{org_name}</code>. For instructions, see [node:8403].</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis</pre>

<p>Sample Response:</p>
<pre>[ "weatherapi" ]</pre>

<h3>Get an API</h3>

<p>You can call the GET method on any API proxy in your organization. This call returns a list of all available revisions of the API proxy.</p>
	
<pre class="terminal">$ curl -u myname:mypass -H "Accept: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/weatherapi</pre>
	
<p>Sample Response:</p>

<pre>{
  "name" : "weatherapi",
  "revision" : [ "1" ]
}</pre>

<p>The only detail returned by this method is the name of the API proxy along with the associated 'revision', which has an associated number. Revisions are sequentially numbered, providing some lightweight versioning capabilities for API proxy configurations.</p>

<p>In this example, there is only one revision because the API proxy was just created. As an API proxy moves through the lifecycle of iterative configuration and deployment, the version number increments by integers. Using direct API calls to deploy, you deploy optionally increment the revision number of the API proxy. Sometimes when you make minor changes, you might not want to increment the revision. </p>

<h3>Get API Revision</h3>

<div class="warning"><p>Don't confuse the <i>version</i> of an API (that is, the public interface) with the <i>revision</i> of an API proxy (that is, the internal number associated with a configuration). The two numbers are unrelated, and the revision number of an API proxy is totally opaque to apps that consume your API.</p></div>
	
<p>The API <i>version</i> (for example, <code>api.company.com/v1</code>) should change very infrequently. When you do increment the API version, it signifies to developers that there has been a significant change in the signature of the external interface exposed by the API. </p>

<p>The API proxy <i>revision</i> is merely an incremented number associated with an API proxy configuration. The API Platform maintains revisions of your configurations so that you can revert a configuration when something goes wrong. By default, an API proxy's revision is automatically incremented every time you deploy an API proxy. This behavior can be overridden in the Management UI and in the API.</p>

<div class="bestpractice"><p>See <a href="http://apigee.com/docs/enterprise/content/add-apis#-a-class-jumplink-name-set-root-id-set-root-a-a-class-jumplink-name-api-versions-id-api-versions-a-api-versions">Versioning an API</a> for guidance and instruction on incrementing the interface version of the API that you expose to external developers.</p>
	
</div>
<p>To obtain the detailed profile of an API proxy configuration, you call the GET method on a specific revision number.</p>

<p>For example, you can call the GET method on API proxy revision 1 to get a detailed view.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -u myname:mypass -H "Accept:application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/weatherapi/revisions/1</pre>
<p><b>Sample Response</b></p>
<pre>{
  "configurationVersion" : {
    "majorVersion" : 4,
    "minorVersion" : 0
  },
  "contextInfo" : "Revision 1 of application weatherapi, in organization {org_name}",
  "createdAt" : 1343178905169,
  "createdBy" : "andrew@apigee.com",
  "lastModifiedAt" : 1343178905169,
  "lastModifiedBy" : "andrew@apigee.com",
  "name" : "weatherapi",
  "policies" : [ ],
  "proxyEndpoints" : [ ],
  "resources" : [ ],
  "revision" : "1",
  "targetEndpoints" : [ ],
  "targetServers" : [ ],
  "type" : "Application"
}</pre>

<p>These API proxy configuration elements are documented in detail in the [node:8407].</p>

<h3>Deploying an API to an environment</h3>

<p>Once your API proxy is configured to receive and forward requests properly, you can deploy it to one or more environments. Usually, you iterate on API proxies in 'test' and then, when ready, you deploy an API proxy to 'prod'. You then publish the 'prod' URL to external developers.</p>
	
<div class="tipstricks"><p>An API proxy cannot be invoked until is has been deployed to an environment.</p></div>

<p>You deploy the API <b>revision</b> to an environment, so the first step is to verify the list of environments in your organization.</p>

<h3>How to list environments</h3>

<p>Every organization on the API Platform has at least two environments: 'test' and 'prod'. The distinction is arbitrary. The goal is to provide you with an area to verify that your API proxy is working properly before you open it up to outside developers.</p>

<p>Each environment is really just a network address, enabling you segregate traffic between the API proxies that you are working on, and those that are being accessed by apps at runtime.</p>

<p>Environments also provide segregation of data and resources. You can for example, set up different caches in test and prod, which can be accessed only by API proxies executing in that environment.</p>

<h3>View environments in an organization</h3>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments</pre>

<p>Sample Response</p>

<pre>[ "test", "prod" ]</pre>

<div class="tiptricks">If you have in On-Premise installation of Apigee Enterprise, you may see a different list of environments.</div>

<h3>Explore Deployments</h3>

<p>A "deployment" is a revision of an API proxy that has been deployed in an environment. An API proxy that is in the 'deployed' state is accessible over the network, at the addresses defined in the VirtualHost for that environment. 
		
<div class="tipstricks">It is often useful to check to see in which environment (and if!) your API is deployed. For example, you might find requests to your API proxy are failing. One troubleshooting step is to ensure that the API proxy is deployed as expected.</div>

<h2>Deploying API proxies</h2>

<p>API proxies cannot be invoked until they have been deployed. The Platform exposes RESTful APIs that provide control over the deployment process.</p>

<div class="bestpractice"><p>The following API calls are called on your behalf by the Python deploy tool. The deploy tool provides support for packaging and importing API proxies that you developer locally, and it also managed undeployment of existing API proxy revisions. Use the direct API calls described below when you need additional control over the deployment process.</p></div>

<p>Only one revision of an API proxy can be deployed in an environment at a given time. Therefore the deployed revision needs to be undeployed. You can control whether the new bundle is deployed as a new revision or whether it overwrites the existing revision.</p>

<p>First undeploy the existing revision:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -X DELETE \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{environment_name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments"
-u myname:mypass</pre>

<p>Then deploy the new revision. (You can deploy using the same revision number, or you can increment it.)</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments" \
-u myname:mypass</pre> 

<div class="warning"><p>Using this approach, there will inevitably be some lag time between the time when the first package is undeployed and the next one is deployed. During this interval calls from apps may be rejected with HTTP code 503 (Service Unavailable). If this is a problem, as it usually is in production deployments, use the seamless deployment option, described below.</p></div>

<h3>Seamless deployment</h3>

<p>To minimize the potential for downtime during deployment, use the <code>override</code> option on the deployment method, and set it to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>You cannot deploy one revision of an API proxy on top of another. The first must always be undeployed. By setting <code>override</code> to <code>true</code>, you indicate that one revision of an API proxy should be deployed over the currently deployed revision. The result is that the deployment sequence is reversed--the new revision is deployed, and once the deployment is complete, the already deployed revision is undeployed.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments?"override=true" \
-u myname:mypass</pre> 

<p>When <code>override=true</code> is used, 503 responses during deployment will be significantly minimized.
</p>

<p>You can further optimize deployment by setting the <code>delay</code> parameter. The <code>delay</code> parameter specifies a time interval, in seconds, before which the previous revision should be undeployed. The effect is that in-flight transactions have a time interval in which to complete before the API proxy processing their transaction is undeployed.</p> 

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/{env-name}/apis/{api_name}/revisions/{revision_number}/deployments?"override=true&delay=5" \
-u myname:mypass</pre> 


<h3>See all deployments of an API Revision</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's necessary to fetch a list of all of the currently deployed revisions of an API proxy.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/weatherapi/revision/1/deployments \
-u myname:mypass </pre>

<pre>{
  "aPIProxy" : "weatherapi",
  "environment" : [ {
    "configuration" : {
      "basePath" : "",
      "steps" : [ ]
    },
    "name" : "test",
    "server" : [ {
      "status" : "deployed",
      "type" : [ "message-processor" ],
      "uUID" : "90096dd1-1019-406b-9f42-fbb80cd01200"
    }, {
      "status" : "deployed",
      "type" : [ "message-processor" ],
      "uUID" : "7d6e2eb1-581a-4db0-8045-20d9c3306549"
    }, {
      "status" : "deployed",
      "type" : [ "router" ],
      "uUID" : "1619e2d7-c822-45e0-9f97-63882fb6a805"
    }, {
      "status" : "deployed",
      "type" : [ "router" ],
      "uUID" : "8a5f3d5f-46f8-4e99-b4cc-955875c8a8c8"
    } ],
    "state" : "deployed"
  } ],
  "name" : "1",
  "organization" : "org_name"
}</pre>

<p>The response above contains many properties specific to the internal infrastructure of the API Platform. Unless you are using Apigee Enterprise on-premise, you can't change these settings.</p>

<p>The important properties contained in the response are <code>organization</code>, <code>environment</code>, <code>aPIProxy</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>state</code>. By reviewing these property values, you can confirm that a specific revision of an API proxy is deployed in an environment.</p>

<h3>See all deployments in the test environment</h3>

<p>You can also retrieve the deployment status for a specific environment (including the revision number of the currently deployed API proxy) using the following call:
</p>
<pre class="terminal">$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/environments/test/deployments</pre>

<p>Returns the same result as above for every API deployed in the test environment
</p>

<h3>See all deployments in your organization</h3>

<p>To fetch a list of all currently deployed revisions of all API proxies in all environments, use the following API method:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/deployments -u myname:mypass </pre>

<p>Returns the same result as above for all API proxies deployed in all environments.
</p>

<p>Since the API is RESTful, you can simply use the POST method, along with a JSON or XML payload, against the same resource to create an API proxy.</p>

<p>A profile for your API proxy is generated on the API Platform. The default representation of an API proxy is JavaScript object notation (JSON). Below is the default JSON response to the POST request above, which created an API proxy called 'weatherapi'. A description of each element in the profile follows:</p>

	<pre>{
  "configurationVersion" : {
    "majorVersion" : 4,
    "minorVersion" : 0
  },
  "contextInfo" : "Revision 1 of application weatherapi, in organization {org_name}",
  "createdAt" : 1357172145444,
  "createdBy" : "you@yourcompany.com",
  "displayName" : "weatherapi",
  "lastModifiedAt" : 1357172145444,
  "lastModifiedBy" : "you@yourcompany.com",
  "name" : "weatherapi",
  "policies" : [ ],
  "proxyEndpoints" : [ ],
  "resources" : [ ],
  "revision" : "1",
  "targetEndpoints" : [ ],
  "targetServers" : [ ],
  "type" : "Application"
}</pre>
	
<div class="tipstricks"><p>Keep in mind that the response payload merely contains a representation of an API resource--you can create an API proxy using JSON or XML, and you can also retrieve representations of the API proxy as XML or JSON, depending on your needs.</p></div>

<p>The API proxy profile that is generated demonstrates the complete structure of an API proxy:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>APIProxy revision</code>: The sequentially numbered iteration of the API proxy configuration, as maintained by the API Platform</li>
	<li><code>APIProxy name</code>: The unique name of the API proxy</li>
	<li><code>ConfigurationVersion</code>: API Platform version to which the API proxy configuration conforms</li>
	<li><code>CreatedAt</code>: Time when the API proxy was generated on the API platform, formatted in UNIX time</li>
	<li><code>CreatedBy</code>: Email address of the Apigee user who created the API proxy</li>
	<li><code>DisplayName</code>: A user-friendly name for the API proxy</li>
	<li><code>LastModifiedAt</code>: Time when the API proxy was generated on the API platform, formatted in UNIX time</li>
	<li><code>LastModifiedBy</code>: Email address of the Apigee user who created the API proxy on the API platform</li>
	<li><code>Policies</code>: A list of policies that have been added to this API proxy</li>
	<li><code>ProxyEndpoints</code>: A list of named ProxyEndpoints</li>
	<li><code>Resources</code>: A list of resources (JavaScript, Python, Java, XSLT) available to be executed in this API proxy</li>
	<li><code>TargetServers</code>: A list of named TargetServers (that can be created using the APi Platform API), used in advanced configurations for load balancing purposes</li>
	<li><code>TargetEndpoints</code>: A list of named TargetEndpoints</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that many of the elements of the API proxy configuration created using the simple POST method above are empty. In the following Developer Guide topics, you will learn how to add and configure the key components of an API proxy.</p>

<p>You can also read about these configuration elements in the [node:8407].</p>

<h2>Scripting against the API</h2>

<p>The [node:4561], available on GitHub provide shell scripts that wrap the Apigee deploy tool. If for some reason you cannot use the Python deploy tool, then you can call the API directly. Both approaches are demonstrated in the sample scripts below.</p>

<h3>Wrapping the Deploy Tool</h3>

<p>First, make sure the <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/tools">Python deploy tool</a> is available in your local environment. </p>
	
<p>Then create a file to hold your credentials. The deployment scripts that you write will import these settings, helping you to centrally manage the credentials for your account. In the API Platform sample, this file is called <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/setup"><code>setenv.sh</code></a>.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

org="Your ORG on enterprise.apigee.com"
username="Your USERNAME on enterprise.apigee.com"

# While testing, it's not necessary to change the setting below
env="test"
# Change the value below only if you have an on-premise deployment
url="https://api.enterprise.apigee.com"
# Change the value below only if you have a custom domain
api_domain="apigee.net"

export org=$org
export username=$username
export env=$env
export url=$url
export api_domain=$api_domain</pre>

<p>The file above makes all of your settings available to the shell scripts that wrap the deploy tool.</p>

<p>Now create a shell script that imports those settings and uses them to call the deploy tool. (You can see an example <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/setup">here</a>.)
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash

source path/to/setenv.sh

echo "Enter your password for the Apigee Enterprise organization $org, followed by [ENTER]:"

read -s password

echo Deploying $proxy to $env on $url using $username and $org

path/to/deploy.py -n {api_name} -u $username:$password -o $org -h $url -e $env -p / -d path/to/apiproxy</pre>

<p>To make your life really easy, also create a script to invoke and test the API, as follows:</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

echo Using org and environment configured in /setup/setenv.sh

source /path/to/setenv.sh

set -x

curl "http://$org-$env.apigee.net/{api_basepath}"</pre>

<h3>Directly invoking the API</h3>

<p>It can be useful to write simple shell scripts that automate the process of uploading and deploying API proxies.</p>

<p>The script below directly invokes the Platform API. It undeploys the existing revision of the API proxy that you are updating, creates a ZIP file from the <code>/apiproxy</code> directory containing your proxy configuration files, and then uploads, imports, and deploys the configuration.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

#This sets the name of the API proxy and the basepath where the API will be available
api=api
	
source /path/to/setenv.sh

echo Delete the DS_store file on OSX

echo find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf

echo "Enter your password for the Apigee Enterprise organization $org, followed by [ENTER]:"

read -s password

echo Undeploy and delete the previous revision

# Note that you need to explicitly update the revision to be undeployed. One benefit of the Python deploy tool is that it manages this for you.

curl -k -u $username:$password "$url/v1/o/$org/apis/$api/revisions/1/deployments?action=undeploy&env=$env" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"

curl -k -u $username:$password -X DELETE "$url/v1/o/$org/apis/$api/revisions/1"

rm -rf $api.zip

echo Create the API proxy bundle and deploy

zip -r $api.zip apiproxy

echo Import the new revision to $env environment 

curl -k -v -u $username:$password "$url/v1/o/$org/apis?action=import&name=$api" -T $api.zip -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -X POST

echo Deploy the new revision to $env environment 

curl -k -u $username:$password "$url/v1/o/$org/apis/$apirevisions/1/deployments?action=deploy&env=$env" -X POST</pre>

<h2>Security guidelines</h2>

<p>The Platform API relies on HTTP Basic Authentication. You need to provide a username and password for each API call.</p>

<p>In some situations, it is not practical to collect the password when the script runs. For example, you may need to run a cron job that fires when no administrators are present. In these situations, you need to make the password available to the script without any human intervention.</p>

<p>Follow these guidelines:</p>

<ol><li>Centralize credentials in a single file that is used as a source for the programs and scripts that you write</li>
<li>Protect the credentials source file to the extent possible using file system security and permissions</li>
<li>Create an automation client with highly restricted permissions on specific resources in your organization. See [Node:9906].</li></ol>
