<p>This topic demonstrates how to setup authorization for your APIs using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type. It references the simpleProxy in the <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples">API Platform Samples</a> available on Github. By following this topic, you will configure the simpleProxy to implement server-side OAuth 2.</p>
<p>For a fully configured API proxy that supports authorization code grant type and a sample login app, see the <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/sample-proxies/oauth-login-app">OAuth Login App</a> sample on GitHub.</p>
<p>This topic builds on the API product, developer, and app that you set up in [node:427]. If you have not done so, follow the steps in [node:427] to set up an app to consume your protected API.</p>
<h2>Background: Three-legged OAuth</h2>
<p>The OAuth authorization code grant type is defined in the <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0 specification</a>. Some readers of the specification find it difficult to understand. As a result, a substantial body of commentary and discussion is available on the Internet. For Apigee's overview of OAuth, see <a href="http://apigee.com/about/api-best-practices/oauth-big-picture-0">OAuth: The Big Picture</a>. In this topic you will focus specifically on how to configure the authorization code grant type on the Apigee API Platform.</p>
<p>Authorization code ('auth code' for short) is implemented by API providers who want to enable their users or customers to leverage existing login credentials to authenticate via third-party client apps, without sharing passwords. Therefore, you should consider implementing authorization code support for your API only if you have an independent mechanism for authenticating users of your services. The benefit of auth code is that your current customer base can authorize third-party client apps to consume your APIs on their behalf. This enables you to delegate app development to approved developers, without requiring app end users to divulge passwords to any entity except you.</p>

<p>On the API Platform, the authorization code grant type is supported through the use of policies. Although these policies enable you to configure auth code support without writing any code, you must still implement a Login app that authenticates app end users and that supports the redirects associated with the auth code grant type. The goal of this topic is to clarify specifically what must be implemented by each party in the OAuth dance.</p>
<p>"Three-legged OAuth" is so named because the pattern involves three distinct interactions among cooperating entities. The three transactions are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Authenticate the app end user, authorize client app, and return an authorization code</li>
	<li>Exchange authorization code for access token</li>
	<li>Use access token to securely invoke protected resource (API)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 5 entities who participate in this 'dance'.</p>

<p>The basic three-legged flow is:</p>
<p><strong>First leg: Part One</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OAuth 2.0 Flow 1a" src="/docs/sites/default/files/oauth1a.png" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;"></p>
<ol>
	<li>App end user navigates to a browser-based Web app</li>
	<li>User clicks the 'login' link in the client app</li>
	<li>The login link invokes a URL on the authorization server</li>
	<li>The authorization endpoint redirects the request (along with relevant information) to the designated Login app.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First leg: Part Two</strong></p>

<p><img alt="OAuth 2.0 Flow 1b" src="/docs/sites/default/files/oauth1b.png" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;"></p>
<ol>
	<li>The Login app collects the app end users username and password. (The Login app provides a way for the app end user to authorize the app to access the API on her behalf.)</li>
	<li>Once authenticated, the app end user is redirected, along with an auth code, back the app.</li>
	<li>The client app handles a call back from the authorization endpoint to obtain the access token from the response. (The authorization endpoint uses the "Callback URL" configured in the profile for the client app to make this callback.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Second leg:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OAuth 2.0 Flow 2" src="/docs/sites/default/files/oauth2.png" style="width: 600px; height: 241px;"></p>
<ol>
	<li>The app generates a request for an access token. The request includes the auth code from the first leg, along with the app's consumer key and secret.</li>
	<li>The app sends this request to a token endpoint, whose URL has been provided out-of-band.</li>
	<li>The token endpoint validates the auth code and the app credentials, and, if they are valid, generates an access token.</li>
	<li>The token endpoint returns the access token to the client app.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Third leg:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="OAuth 2.0 Flow 3" src="/docs/sites/default/files/oauth3.png" style="width: 600px; height: 144px;"></p>
<ol>
	<li>The app generates a request that includes the access token to the protected API</li>
	<li>The protected API validates the access token and evaluates any 'scope' parameters attached to the request</li>
	<li>If the access token is valid for the request API resource and scope, then the resource is returned to the app.</li>
</ol>
<p>The app developer must implement an auth code client capable of generating the three requests.</p>
<p>The API provider must implement:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A login app</li>
	<li>An authorization server (also called an 'authorization endpoint')</li>
	<li>An access token server (also called an 'token endpoint')</li>
	<li>A validation step to check access tokens against a token store</li>
</ol>
<p>The API platform enables you to setup 2, 3, and 4 using policies.</p>
<h2>Configure authorization endpoint</h2>
<p>The authorization endpoint is configured on the API Platform by creating two policies: A redirect policy and a GenerateAuthCode policy. Each policy is attached to a unique URI. Those URIs are provided out-of-band to client app developers.</p>
<h3>Redirect to login page</h3>
<p>The authorization endpoint is responsible for redirecting the inbound request from the client app to the API provider's Login app, where the app end user can safely authenticate and authorize the client app without divulging passwords. This policy serves to redirect requests from the client app to the URL of your Login app, along with relevant information from the client app request.</p>
<p>One way to configure the redirect is by using a RaiseFault Policy. (You could also implement this functionality using an AssignMessage or ServiceCallout policy, or by implementing an HTTP client in JavaScript, Python, or Java.)</p>
<p>The following policy assumes that client app includes three query parameters (defined in the OAuth 2 specification) as part of the request:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>client_id</code>: The consumer key (API key) of the client app</li>
	<li><code>response_type</code>: The response type requested by the client app (in this case auth code)</li>
	<li><code>scope</code>: Any scopes included by the client app. A&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;equates to a 'permission'. The Login app may optionally display the requested scope(s) to the app end user, to enable the user to provide informed consent on the operations requested by the client app. Authorized scopes are checked when the access token is validated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those values are obtained by the policy by accessing variables. (Note: All query parameters on a request message are automatically set as variables by the API Platform. You do not need to explicitly set these variables before accessing them in this policy.)</p>

<pre>&lt;RaiseFault name="RedirectToLoginApp"&gt;
  &lt;IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&gt;true&lt;/IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&gt;
  &lt;FaultResponse&gt;
    &lt;Set&gt;
    &lt;Headers&gt;
    &lt;Header name="Location"&gt;{login_app_URL}?client_id={request.queryparam.client_id}&amp;response_type={request.queryparam.response_type}&amp;scope={request.queryparam.scope}&lt;/Header&gt;
    &lt;/Headers&gt;
    &lt;Payload contentType="text/plain"&gt;{login_app_URL}?client_id={request.queryparam.client_id}&amp;amp;response_type={request.queryparam.response_type}&amp;amp;scope={request.queryparam.scope}
	    &lt;/Payload&gt;
    &lt;StatusCode&gt;302&lt;/StatusCode&gt;
      &lt;ReasonPhrase&gt;Login App Redirect&lt;/ReasonPhrase&gt;
    &lt;/Set&gt;
  &lt;/FaultResponse&gt;
&lt;/RaiseFault&gt;</pre>

<p>Remember that the policy above only demonstrates one way of configuring the redirect. You can also enable redirects using JavaScript, Java, or another type of policy such as AssignMessage.</p>

<h3>Generate authorization code</h3>

<p>After authenticating the user, the Login app calls back to the authorization endpoint, including in the request the <code>client_id</code>, <code>response_type</code>, and <code>scope</code>.</p>

<p>A policy of type OAuthV2 that specifies the GenerateAuthCode is attached to the URI called by the Login app.</p>
<h4>GenerateAuthCode Policy</h4>

<p>This policy configures the authorization endpoint.</p>

<p>Under <code>/apiproxy/policies</code> create a file called <code>GenerateAuthCode.xml</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="GenerateAuthCode"&gt;
  &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAuthorizationCode&lt;/Operation&gt;
  &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;

	</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Configure token endpoint</h2>
<p>The token endpoint is responsible for validating an authorization code, consumer key/secret, and the <code>redirect_uri</code> associated with the client app. On the API Platform, the <code>redirect_uri</code> is provided at app creation time. In the app profile, <code>redirect_uri</code> is the value of "Callback URL".</p>
<h4>GenerateAccessToken Policy</h4>

<p>This is the same policy that is configured for client credentials in [node:819], only in this case the policy is configured to support the authorization code grant type.</p>

<p>This policy configures the token endpoint. The policy configures a token endpoint that returns an access token in exchange for a valid authorization code.</p>

<p>Create this policy as a file called <code>GenerateAccessToken.xml</code> under <code>/apiproxy/policies</code> with the following content:</p>

<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="GenerateAccessToken"&gt;
  &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;!-- This is in millseconds, so expire in an hour --&gt;
  &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;3600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;
  &lt;SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;authorization_code&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;/SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
&lt;GrantType&gt;request.queryparam.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
&lt;Code&gt;request.queryparam.code&lt;/Code&gt;
&lt;ClientId&gt;request.queryparam.client_id&lt;/ClientId&gt;
&lt;RedirectUri&gt;request.queryparam.redirect_uri&lt;/RedirectUri&gt;
&lt;Scope&gt;request.queryparam.scope&lt;/Scope&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<p>Note the main difference between this policy and the one you configured to support the client credentials grant type. In the policy above,  SupportedGrantTypes now specifies <code>authorization_code</code> instead of <code>client_credentials</code>. The policy support multiple grant types per configuration. For example, if you need to support both <code>authorization_code</code> and <code>client_credentials</code> you can include them both in the list of SupportedGrantTypes.</p>

<p>For each grant type, you need to specify the expected locations for each parameter that the client app includes in the request. For auth code, you need to specify the location of the auth code, the client ID, the redirect URI, and the scope. For flexibility, the GenerateAccessToken policy lets you dfine HTTP headers, query parameters, and form parameters as locations for these parameters.</p>

<p>The example below demonstrates the same parameters as HTTP headers:</p>

<pre>&lt;GrantType&gt;request.header.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
&lt;Code&gt;request.header.code&lt;/Code&gt;
&lt;ClientId&gt;request.header.client_id&lt;/ClientId&gt;
&lt;RedirectUri&gt;request.header.redirect_uri&lt;/RedirectUri&gt;
&lt;Scope&gt;request.header.scope&lt;/Scope&gt;</pre>

<p>Or, you can mix and match headers and query parameters:</p>

<pre>&lt;GrantType&gt;request.header.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
&lt;Code&gt;request.header.code&lt;/Code&gt;
&lt;ClientId&gt;request.queryparam.client_id&lt;/ClientId&gt;
&lt;RedirectUri&gt;request.queryparam.redirect_uri&lt;/RedirectUri&gt;
&lt;Scope&gt;request.queryparam.scope&lt;/Scope&gt;</pre>

<p>Note: Only one location can be configured per parameter.</p>

<h2>Attaching OAuth policies to the ProxyEndpoint</h2>

<p>3-legged OAuth requires three endpoints. You can include the three endpoints in a single ProxyEndpoint configuration.</p>
	
<p>For the client to initiate the three-legged protocol, define the following endpoints and publish the following URIs. (You can use any naming convention that you want. The following are just examples):</p>
<ul>
	<li>A URI to redirect the user agent (Web browser) to the provider's Login app:
		<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorize</pre>
	</li>
	<li>A URI to obtain an authorization code:
		<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorizationcode</pre>
	</li>
	<li>A URI to obtain an access token:
		<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/oauth/accesstoken</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that for security in production, <b>you must use HTTPS for these URLs</b>. In this case, for simplicity, we use HTTP.) These endpoint URIs are published out-of-band. That is, app developers must be informed of these URIs so that they know how to obtain authorization codes and access tokens before they can access a protected resource.</p>

<p>On the API Platform, these endpoints are created using a ProxyEndpoint configuration that defines three conditional Flows.</p>

<p>In this example, the respective conditional Flows are named <code>RedirectToLoginApp</code>, <code>GetAuthCode</code>, and <code>GetAccessToken</code>.</p>

<p>A different URI must be assigned to each Flow. (Again, these are just examples. You can name these URIs whatever you want.):</p>
<ul>
	<li>RedirectToLoginApp: <code>/oauth/authorize</code></li>
	<li>GetAuthCode: <code>/oauth/authorizationcode</code></li>
	<li>GetAccessToken: <code>/oauth/accesstoken</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this configuration, to obtain an auth code, an app developer first redirects the app end user's user agent (Web browser) to the Login app by calling:</p>
	 <pre>http://myorg-test.apigee.net/weather/oauth/authorize?client_id={consumer_key}&amp;response_type=auth_code&amp;redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&amp;scope=(scope1,scope2)&amp;state={some_string}</pre>.
	
<p>The Login app then authenticates the app end user and enables the app end user to authorize the app. (The client app developer has no role in this step.)</p>

<p>The Login app then calls the second URI to initiate the callback that provides an auth code to the client app:</p>

<pre>http://myorg-test.apigee.net/weather/oauth/authorizationcode?client_id={consumer_key}&amp;response_type=auth_code&amp;scope=(scope1,scope2)&amp;state={some_string}</pre>

<p>The OAUthV2 policy attached to the endpoint at <code>/oauth/authorizationcode</code> redirects the app end user's user agent to the requesting client app.</p>

<p>The client app parses redirect response to extract the authorization code. After obtaining the authorization code, the app uses the code to obtain an access token from the token endpoint at:</p>

<pre>http://myorg-test.apigee.net/weather/oauth/accesstoken?auth_code={auth_code}&amp;redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&amp;grant_type=auth_code</pre>

<p>Along with the request stringabove, the client app must Base64-encode the consumer key and secret and include the resulting value in the POST request as an HTTP Authorzation header.</p>
	
<pre>"Authorization: Basic WExvdEwzUFJ4TmtVR1hoR0FGRFBPcjZmcXR2QWh1WmU6aU5VeUVhT09oOTZLUjNZTA=="</pre>

<p>Finally, the app calls <code>http://myorg-test.apigee.net/weather?access_code={access_code}</code> using the access token to retrieve a weather forecast on behalf of the app end user.</p>

<p>The following ProxyEndpoint (<code>/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml</code>) implements this Flow structure:</p>

	<pre>&lt;Flows&gt;
  &lt;Flow name="RedirectToLoginApp"&gt;
    &lt;!-- This policy flow is selected when the URI path suffix matches&nbsp;/oauth/authorize --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Publish this URI to developers to use for their 'login' link --&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix == "/oauth/authorize"&lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
	&lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;RedirectToLoginPage&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
  &lt;/Flow&gt;
  &lt;Flow name="GetAuthCode"&gt;
    &lt;!-- This policy flow is selected when the URI path suffix matches&nbsp;/oauth/authorizationcode --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Call this URL from your Login app after you authenticate the user --&gt;
    &lt;!-- The policy will automatically return the auth code in the response to the redirect_uri  --&gt;
    &lt;!-- on file for the requesting app   --&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix == "/oauth/authorizationcode"&lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
	&lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateAuthCode&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
  &lt;/Flow&gt;
  &lt;Flow name="GetAccessToken"&gt;
    &lt;!-- This policy flow is selected when the URI path suffix matches&nbsp;/oauth/accesstoken --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Publish this URL to app developers to use when obtaining an access token using an auth code   --&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;proxy.pathsuffix == "/oauth/accesstoken"&lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;Request&gt;
	&lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
    &lt;/Request&gt;
  &lt;/Flow&gt;
&lt;/Flows&gt;</pre>

<h2>Importing and deploying the API proxy</h2>
<p>The deploy tool can be used to import the API proxy. Substitute username and password for <code>myname:mypass</code>, and your Apigee organization for <code>myorg</code>.</p>

<h2>Runtime Interaction</h2>

<p>By deploying this API proxy, you now have a dedicated set of OAuth endpoints available across the APIs in your organization. You can reuse these endpoints across all APIs in your organization. To secure an API call, attach an OAUthV2 policy that defines the operation <code>VerifyAccessToken</code> to the resource that you want to protect.</p>

<h2>Retrieving an access token and making an authorized API request</h2>

<p>To authenticate the user and get the access token, the user agent is redirected to your Login page.</p>

<p>In the request below:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>client_id</code> must be the same <code>consumerKey</code> for the requesting app</li>
	<li><code>redirect_uri</code>must be the same as the <code>callbackUrl</code> for requesting app (in this example <code>login.weatherapp.com</code>)</li>
</ul>

<pre>$ curl  "http://myorg-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id={consumer_key}&amp;redirect_uri=login.weatherapp.com&amp;scope=READ&amp;state=foobar"</pre>
	
<p>This request returns an HTTP 302 redirect response whose Location value is populated using the URL that you define in the Redirect policy to point at your Login app. Thus, in response to this request, the user's Web browser is redirected to your Login page, where the user can authenticate herself and authorize the client app.</p>

<p>Your Login app then calls:</p>

<pre>$ curl  "http://myorg-test.apigee.net/oauth/authorizationcode?response_type=code&amp;client_id={consumer_key}&amp;scope=READ&amp;state=foobar"</pre>

<p>This command returns an authorization code, along with an HTTP 302 redirect response whose <code>Location</code> value is populated using the <code>callback_url</code> on file for the requesting app:</p>

<pre>HTTP/1.1 302 Found Location:login.weatherapp.com?scope=READ&amp;state=foobar&amp;code={auth_code}</pre>


<p>Note the <code>state</code> parameter. This parameter is designed prevent cross-site request forgery attacks and should be unique for every request. While it is not required, it is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>After the redirect back to the callback_url, the client app must collect the authorization code from the response message, and then generate a request for an access token.</p>

<p>To construct the POST request, the requesting app must Base64-encode the consumer key and secret, and then set that as the value of the HTTP <code>Basic authorization</code> header, as in this example:</p>

<pre>$ curl -H "Authorization: Basic WExvdEwzUFJ4TmtVR1hoR0FGRFBPcjZmcXR2QWh1WmU6aU5VeUVhT09oOTZLUjNZTA==" "http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/oauth/accesstoken?grant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=neIu0d8e&amp;redirect_uri=login.weatherapp.com&amp;scope=READ"</pre>

<p>If the authorization code and app credentials are valid, the API Platform responds with an access token:</p>

	<pre>{ "issued_at":1345073930832, "scope":"READ", "application_name":"weatherapp", "status":"approved", "organization_id":0, "expires_in":3599, "api_profile_name":"null", "refresh_token":"SlE9lNYf", "access_token":"I29OwHlGRi1AkbBCIRLLMC5efFgu", "refresh_count":0 }</pre>

<p>The access token returned by the API Platform can then be used by the client app to make a request to the protected resource (the target API). Insert the access token in the request as a the value of <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> header.</p>

<pre>$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer I29OwHlGRi1AkbBCIRLLMC5efFgu" https://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282&amp;</pre>
