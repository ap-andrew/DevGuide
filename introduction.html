<h2>What's here?</h2>
<p>The API Proxy Developer Guide is designed to get you up and and running with local development of API proxies that deploy and scale on the Apigee API Platform. 
	
<p>The focus of development on the API Platform is the API proxy. An API proxy is an application that runs on the Apigee API Platform and which serves as a proxy for one or more backend services or APIs. Every API proxy that you deploy on the API Platform exposes a new API that can be consumed by apps.</p>

<pre>For an overview of how the API Platform can help you as a developer, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3W6JSgGoO_o"><b>Watch the video</b></a>.</pre>

<p>Using API proxies, you can proxy any publicly available API, which makes the API Platform a great solution for developers who need to customize the behavior of APIs--whether the developer controls the API or not. Once you proxy an API with an API proxy, all of the enterprise capabilities of Apigee are at your disposal. You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Leverage a policy library to implement common behavior without writing any code</li>
	<li>Innovate on the API Platform by writing and deploying custom code in the Cloud</li>
	<li>Combine policies and custom code to create sophisticated yet easy-to-manage and secure applications</li>
	<li>Provision and manage API keys and OAuth authorization</li>
	<li>Monitor the operational performance of APIs</li>
	<li>Track and analyze consumption patterns by developers and apps</li>
	<li>Expose the capabilities that you implement as APIs, complete with an API Console, enabling re-use across projects or sharing with other developers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This Developer Guide provides instruction on local development of API proxies. You don't need to be an expert in any of these topics, but, when building API proxies, it's useful to have some familiarity with the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Representational State Transfer (REST)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript Object Notation</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">Extensible Markup Language</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema">XML Schema</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally:</p>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript and Python scripting languages</li>
	<li>Java programming language</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create API proxies in the <a href="enterprise.apigee.com">API Platform Management UI</a>. For instructions, refer to the the <a href="/docs/enterprise/content/user_guide">API Platform User Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>What you'll learn</h2>

<p>In this Developer Guide you will learn:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How to configure a basic API proxy</li>
	<li>How to upload, deploy, and test API proxies on the API Platform</li>
	<li>How to configure policies and attach them to an API proxy</li>
	<li>How to write scripts and code that execute as components of an API proxy</li>
	<li>How to implement common use cases required by API developers</li>
	<li>How to expose and reuse your policy compositions and code as APIs using WADL and API Consoles</li>
	<li>How to configure environment settings for your organization on the API Platform</li>
</ul>

<h2>But I am an app developer!</h2>

<p>If you are an app developer, it may not be immediately obvious how the API Platform can help you. But, consider this. Your apps consume APIs. What if you were able to customize the behavior of the APIs that your app consumes?</p>
	
<p>For example, you might be disappointed that an API you want to consume only supports XML and not JSON. Using the API Platform, you can create an API proxy that converts responses from XML to JSON on the fly. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that you can offload app logic to the API Platform. For example, if you are combining data from multiple APIs in your app, you could move this logic to the API Platform. By writing some fairly simple JavaScript, you can create lightweight applications that run on the API Platform, thereby offloading the processing and network calls from your app.</p>
	
<p>By configuring an API proxy, you can return the result of multiple API calls as a single, highly optimized response to your app. You can even share your work on the API Platform with other app developers by publishing your API--all without the hassle actually building, deploying, and hosting APIs on your own.</p>
