<p>The previous topic [node:3972] demonstrates how to configure simple API key validation. In this topic, you enhance API key-based security by configuring OAuth client credentials to provide authorization for APIs.</p>

<p>OAuth is an authorization protocol. OAuth enables app end users to authorize apps to act on their behalf. Apps do so by obtaining 'access tokens'. Instead of logging in to your API using traditional username/password credentials, apps present access tokens with each request to your API. The API Platform ensures that the access token is valid before it enables apps to access the data that belongs to the app end user.</p>
	
<p>OAuth access tokens have been compared to 'valet keys'. A valet key is a car key that only unlocks doors and starts the car. A valet key cannot be used to open the trunk or the glove compartment. Thus, access tokens enforce a limited capabilities model of security. For example, an access token can enable an app to access the app end user's bank account to read a checking account balance, but not to issue an electronic funds transfer.</p>

<p>OAuth defines procedures, called 'grant types', for issuing access tokens. In this topic, you configure the most basic grant type defined by the OAuth specification: 'client credentials'.</p>

<h2>Client credentials grant type</h2>

<p>The client credentials grant type defines a procedure for issuing access token in exchange for a valid consumer key and secret pair. ('Client credentials' refers to the consumer key and secret pair itself.) In short, OAuth client credentials makes it easy for apps to obtain access tokens using common consumer key and secret pairs.</p>

<p>For this reason, it is relatively simple to 'step up' from API key validation to OAuth client credentials. They both use the same consumer key and secret to validate the client app. You can use the consumer key and secret generated for your app in [node:427] to retrieve access tokens from the endpoint you configure in this topic.</p>

<p>The full specification for the client credentials grant can be found in the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31#section-1.3.4">OAuth 2.0 Specification</a>. </p>
	
<div class="tipstricks"><p>Client credentials are sometimes also called "API key and secret" or "app key and secret". The terms are interchangeable and refer to the same credentials.</p></div>

<h2>Default client credentials endpoints</h2>

<p>You don't have to do anything to enable OAuth client credentials for your APIs. Apigee provides free, out-of-the-box OAuth token endpoints that support the client credentials grant type.</p>

<p>Each organization (even a free trial org) on the API Platform is provisioned with OAuth access token token endpoint. You can begin using the token endpoint as soon as you create an account on <a href="https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up">Apigee Enterprise</a>.</p>

<p>The default OAuth endpoint exposes the following endpoint URI:</p>

<pre>/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</pre>

<p>Publish this URI to developers who need to obtain access tokens. App developers configure their apps to call this endpoint, presenting their consumer key and secret pairs to obtain access tokens.</p>

<p>The default client credentials token endpoint is exposed over the network at the following URL:</p>

<pre>https://{org_name}-{env_name}.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</pre>

<p>For example, if your organization name is "apimakers", the URL would be:</p>

<pre>https://apimakers-test.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken</pre>

<p>This is the URL that developers call to obtain access tokens.</p>

<div class="tipstricks"><p>By default, out-of-the-box OAuth endpoints are only deployed in the test environment. Before they are available in prod, you must explicitly deploy the API proxy called <code>oauth</code> to <code>prod</code>.</p></div>

<h2>Obtaining an access token</h2>

<p>To invoke protected APIs, apps need access tokens. They obtain access tokens by presenting consumer key/secret pairs to the token endpoint described above. You can try this using any consumer key/secret pair that is valid in your organization. For example, you can use the Platform API to retrieve the consumer key and secret for the app created in [node:427]:</p>

<div class="tipstricks">For security, access tokens are valid only in the environment ('test' or 'prod') in which they were issued. Access tokens issued in the test environment cannot be used in the prod environment, and vice-versa. </div>

<p>You can see a list of apps in your organization by making the following API call:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apps \
-u myname:mypass </pre>

<p>This call returns a list of apps by app ID. </p>

<pre>[ "da496fae-2a04-4a5c-b2d0-709278a6f9db", "50e3e831-175b-4a05-8fb6-05a54701af6e" ]</pre>

<p>You can retrieve an app's profile by making a simple GET call on the app ID:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apps/{app_id} \
-u myname:mypass </pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apps/da496fae-2a04-4a5c-b2d0-709278a6f9db \
-u myname:mypass </pre>

<h4>The API call returns the profile of the app you specified. For example, an app profile for weatherapp has the following JSON representation:</h4>

	<pre>{
  "accessType" : "read",
  "apiProducts" : [ ],
  "appFamily" : "default",

}</pre>

<div class="tipstricks">You can also get the consumer key and secret for an app in the <b><a href="https://enterprise.apigee.com">Management UI</a></b>. Navigate to <b>Publish > Developer Apps</b> and select the name of the app whose credentials you need.</div>

<p>Note the values for <code>consumerKey</code> and <code>consumerSecret</code>. You use these credentials to obtain an access token by presenting them as Basic Authentication credentials in an HTTP request, as shown below. The grant type is presented as a query parameter to the request. (Be sure to change the value of the variable {org_name} to reflect the name of your organization on the API Platform.)</p>

<p>In the following request substitute the value of your <code>consumerKey</code> for <code>client_id</code>. Substitute the value of the associated <code>consumerSecret</code> for <code>client_secret</code>. </p>

(Also, of course, substitute your organization name for <code>{org_name}</code>.)

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/oauth/client_credential/accesstoken?grant_type=client_credentials -X POST -d 'client_id=bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpVKNhGar6K&client_secret=hAr4Gn0gA9vAyvI4'</pre>

<p>The API Platform verifies the consumer key and secret and then generates a response containing the access token for this app:</p>

	<pre>{
  "issued_at" : "1380892555397",
  "application_name" : "957aa73f-25c2-4ead-8021-adc01f0d2c6b",
  "scope" : "",
  "status" : "approved",
  "api_product_list" : "[oauth-test]",
  "expires_in" : "3599",
  "developer.email" : "tesla@weathersample.com",
  "organization_id" : "0",
  "client_id" : "bBGAQrXgivA9lKu7NMPyoYpVKNhGar6K",
  "access_token" : "ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z",
  "organization_name" : "rqa",
  "refresh_token_expires_in" : "0",
  "refresh_count" : "0"
}</pre>

<p>Note the <code>access_token</code> value in the response above. This is the access token that the app will use to gain runtime access to protected resources. The access token for this app is <code>ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z</code>.</p>

<p>You now have a valid access token that can be used to access protected APIs.</p>

<h2>Protecting APIs</h2>

<p>To protect APIs, you need to make sure that the API Platform checks for a valid access tokens. You do this by applying a policy of type OAuthV2 that specifies the operation VerifyAccessToken.</p>

<h3>VerifyOAuthTokens policy of type OAuthV2</h3>

<p>First configure the policy as follows:</p>

<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="VerifyOAuthTokens"&gt; 
  &lt;Operation&gt;VerifyAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt; 
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<h3>Policy settings</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table" style="width: 690px;">
	  <thead>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Default</th>
		<th>Required?</th>
     </thead>
<tbody>
	
<tr><td><b><code>OAuthV2</code></b></td><td colspan="3">The policy type</td></tr>

	<tr><td><code>name</code></td>
	<td>The name of the policy, which is referenced in the API proxy Endpoint configuration.</td>
	<td>N/A</td>
	<td>Yes</td></tr>
	
		<tr><td><code>Operation</code></td>
	<td>The operation to be executed by the OAuthV2 policy. By specifying VerifyAccessToken, you configure the policy to check requests for access tokens, and to verify that the access token is valid, has not expired, and is approved to consume the requested API resource (URI). (To make this check, the policy reads the API product that the app is approved to consume.)</td>
	
	<td>N/A</td>
	<td>Yes</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Save the policy as a file called VerifyOAuthTokens.xml. Store the policy in the API proxy that contains the API resources you need to protect, under the <code>/apiproxy/policies</code> directory.</p>

<p>After you have created the policy, attach it to the request PreFlow of the API proxy that you want to protect:</p>

<pre>&lt;PreFlow&gt;
  &lt;Request&gt;
    &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;VerifyOAuthTokens&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;/Request&gt;
&lt;/PreFlow&gt;</pre>

<h2>Using an access token to access a protected resource</h2>
	
<p>To access a protected resource, include the access token in the request as an "Authorization" HTTP header as follows: </p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ylSkZIjbdWybfs4fUQe9BqP0LH5Z" http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

<p>The API Platform validates that the access token presented is valid for the API product, and then grants access, returning the weather report.</p>

<h2>Modifying the token endpoint configuration</h2>

<p>A token endpoint is configured using a policy of type <code>OAuthV2</code> that specifies the <code>GenerateAccessToken</code> operation.</p>

<p>This policy configures the behavior of the token endpoint, which will distribute OAuth 2.0 access tokens to apps that present valid credentials. The policy is configured in a file called <code>GenerateAccessToken.xml</code>with the following content:</p>

	<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="GenerateAccessToken"&gt;
  &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
  &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;3600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;
  &lt;SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;client_credentials&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;/SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;request.queryparam.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>


<h3>Policy settings</h3>

			<tr><td><code>GrantType</code></td>
	<td>Specifies the location in the request message where the app should indicate the desired grant type. The location can be set to HTTP header, query parameter, or form parameter.</td>

<h2>Customizing access tokens</h2>

<p>A common requirement is that access tokens need to be augmented with some custom attributes. For example, you may need to tie an access token to a device ID or to a User-Agent. You can do this by setting the Attribute element on the GenerateAccessToken policy used to issue access tokens.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

	<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name="GenerateAccessToken"&gt;
  &lt;Operation&gt;GenerateAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
  &lt;ExpiresIn&gt;3600000&lt;/ExpiresIn&gt;
  &lt;SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;client_credentials&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;/SupportedGrantTypes&gt;
    &lt;GrantType&gt;request.queryparam.grant_type&lt;/GrantType&gt;
  &lt;GenerateResponse/&gt;
  &lt;Attributes&gt;
    &lt;Attribute name=&quot;user-agent&quot; ref=&quot;request.header.User-Agent&quot; display=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;/Attribute&gt;
  &lt;/Attributes&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<p>When an access token is generated by the policy, the value of the variable <code>request.header.User-Agent</code> will be added to the profile of the access token. It can be be used in token validation Flow to verify that the access token is being used on the same User-Agent type as the original requesting app.</p>
	
<p>By setting display to <code>false</code>, you indicate that the value should not be embedded in the access token returned to the app. The value is stored on the API Platform and can be retrieved along with the access token profile.</p>

<h2>Working with scopes</h2>

<p>'Scope' is a term used in OAuth to designate a granular permission associated with an access token. A set of scopes can be sued to define the permissions that an app end users grants to an app. For example, the app end user might grant an READ permission, but not WRITE permission. The scope READ would then be included in the the access token issued to the app.</p>

<p>On the API Platform, scopes are completely optional. You can use scopes to achieve finer-grained authorization, beyond the definition of a proxy and associated URIs. Every consumer key issued to an app is associated with a 'master scope'. The master scope is the set of all scopes in all API products for which an app has been approved. For apps approved to consume multiple API products, the master scope is the union of all scopes defined in the API products for which the consumer key has been approved.</p>

<p>When an app makes a request for an access token, the app includes the requested scopes in the request (usually as query parameters). The API Platform returns the access token only if the requested scopes are found in the master scope for the apps' consumer key.</p>

<p>To validate scopes, you can explicitly set required scopes in the VerifyAccessToken operation, as follows:</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;OAuthV2 name=&quot;VerifyOAuthAccessToken&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Operation&gt;VerifyAccessToken&lt;/Operation&gt;
  &lt;Scope&gt;READ WRITE&lt;/Scope&gt;
&lt;/OAuthV2&gt;</pre>

<p>The policy will validate that consumer's access token presented contains the require scope. (The order in which the scopes are listed does no matter, though scope's must be spelled the same, including capitalization.</p>

<h2>Logging users out by invalidating access tokens</h2>

<p>When users log out of a service secured with OAuth, you need to invalidate the app user's access token.</p>

<p>The API Platform enables you to do this in two ways. You can invalidate tokens by:</p>
<ul><li>Making a direct API call. See [node:12294]</li>
	
<li>Use the InvalidateToken policy to configure an endpoint designed to invalidate tokens. See [node:33]</li></ul>
