<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Role-based access control governs the actions that may be taken by Apigee users upon entities (APIs, API products, apps, developers, and reports) in an Apigee organization.</p>
<p>Two important clarifications before you begin:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The role-based access control covered here protects artifacts that are created by the Apigee API Platform. They do not provide runtime role-based access to the APIs that you expose via API facades. To configure authorization for your APIs, please refer to [node:3972]</li>
	<li>Resources protected by RBAC in Apigee are distinct from 'API resources'. Therefore, we refer to these protected resources as RBAC Resources</li>
</ul>
<h3>Users and User Roles</h3>
<p>A person with an account in an Apigee organization may be of one of two types: 'organization administrator' or 'user'. Organization administrators create and manage&nbsp;user roles, which define permissions on entities within an Apigee organization.</p>
<h4>Organization Administrators</h4>
<p>Administrators have capabilities that cover users, user roles, and RBAC-protected resources.</p>
<p>Organization administrators can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create, edit, and delete users</li>
	<li>Create, edit, and delete user roles</li>
	<li>Create, edit, and delete RBAC resources</li>
	<li>Define permissions (GET, PUT, DELETE) on RBAC resources</li>
	<li>Provision users with user roles</li>
	<li>Revoke user roles</li>
</ul>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Users are provisioned with user roles by organization administrators.</p>
<p>User roles in turn provide users with permissions (GET, PUT/POST, DELETE) on RBAC resources.</p>
<h3>RBAC Resources</h3>
<p>RBAC resources are of two types: collections and members of a collection.</p>
<p><b>Collections: </b>A<b>&nbsp;</b>set of RBAC resources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>APIs</li>
	<li>API Products</li>
	<li>Apps</li>
	<li>Developers</li>
	<li>Reports</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Members of a collection:</b> A named instance within a collection, for example, an API called 'weatherapi', an API product called 'premium_product', or an app called 'weatherapp'.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>User Roles</h4>
<p>A user role is defined by a set of permissions on an RBAC resource. Organization administrators are free to name user roles. For example, an organization administrator can create user roles called 'development', 'testing, 'release', 'operations', and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p>A permission is a capability on an RBAC resource. The functional distinction among user roles depends upon which group is permitted to create, read, or update an RBAC resource collection, or to create, read, update&nbsp;and delete an RBAC resource singleton. (RBAC collections cannot be deleted en masse, regardless of user role.)</p>
<p>Apigee defines three permissions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>GET: Enables a user to view a list of RBAC resources or to view a singleton RBAC resource</li>
	<li>PUT: Enables a user to create or modify an RBAC resource (encompassing both PUT and POST HTTP methods)</li>
	<li>DELETE: Only supported on singletons, enables a user to delete an RBAC resource. <em>Users cannot delete collections of RBAC resources</em></li>
</ul>
<p>RBAC permissions can be scoped to RBAC resource collections or individual members of a resource collection. For example, permissions for a role can set on all API products, or they can be set on an individual API product. Any permission for a role is inherited by all members of that collection, unless that permission has been explicitly overridden for any member of the resource collection. For example, if the organization administrator configures the GET permission for the 'testing' role on an individual API product, then the new permission overrides any inherited GET/PUT permission for the 'testing' role that may exist for the API product resource collection.</p>
<h2>Define RBAC Resources</h2>
<p>Each collection must be registered as a 'resource' under the URI <code>/resources</code>.</p>
<p>To view collections protected by RBAC:</p>
<h4>List RBAC Resources</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources</pre>
	<p>To define RBAC resources to be protected in your Apigee organization:</p>
</div>
<h4>Define API proxy RBAC resource</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "API", "path" : "/applications"}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Define API product RBAC resource</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "API Products","path" : "/apiproducts"}' </pre>
</div>
<h4>Define app RBAC resource</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "Apps","path" : "/apps"}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Define developer RBAC resource</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "Developers","path" : "/developers"}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Define reports RBAC resource</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "Reports","path" : "/reports"}'</pre>
</div>
<h2>Provision Users and Roles</h2>
<h4>Create a user in your Apigee organization</h4>
<div id="well">
	<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"emailId" : "justauser@apigee.com","firstName" : "Justa","lastName" : "User", "password" : "secret" }'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Create a role: development</h4>
<p>Create a 'development' role to enable developers to view, create, and update API proxies.</p>
<div id="well">
	<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{ "role" : [ { "name" : "development" } ] }'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Add permissions to development role</h4>
<p>The permissions that can be set on collections are GET and PUT. The permissions that can be set on individual members of a collection are GET, PUT, and DELETE. For the 'development' role, we add GET and PUT permissions on APIs. GET enables users to view any APIs, including API proxy configuration files, associated policies, Javascript, XSLT files, and so on. The PUT permission on APIs enables developers to create, modify, import, export, deploy and undeploy API proxies.</p>
<div id="well">
	<pre>curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles/development/permissions -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"path" : "/applications","permissions" : [ "put", "get" ]}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Create a role: testing</h4>
<p>Create a 'testing' role to enable quality engineers to view API proxies and their contents (including, for example, policies).</p>
<div id="well">
	<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"name" : "testing"}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Add permissions to testing role</h4>
<p>GET enables users to view any APIs, including their configuration files, as well as any associated policies, Javascript, XSLT files, and so on. BY adding thispermission to the 'testing' role, we enable quality engineers to view the contents of the APIs that they are testing. Users in this role will not, however, be able&nbsp;&nbsp;to create, modify, import, export, deploy and undeploy API proxies.</p>
<div id="well">
	<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/userroles/testing/permissions -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"path" : "/applications","permissions" : [ "get" ]}'</pre>
</div>
<h4>Add user to testing role</h4>
<div id="well">To provision a user with a user role,
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"role" : [ {"name" : "testing"} ] }'</pre>
	</div>
	<h4>View APIs as user</h4>
	Impersonate the user and make request to the API Platform to view API proxies. The user should be able to view APIs, along with their contents.
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis</pre>
		<pre>$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis/{someAPI}/policies</pre>
	</div>
	<h4>Create API as user in testing role</h4>
	Impersonate the user and make request to the API Platform to create an API proxy. The request will be rejected by the API Platform, as the role 'testing' does not permit the user to create APIs.
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -X POST -d'{"name" : "rbacTestApi"}'</pre>
	</div>
	<h4>Add user to development role</h4>
	Now provision the user with the 'development' role.
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"role" : [ {"name" : "development"} ] }'</pre>
	</div>
	<h4>Create API as user in development role</h4>
	Impersonate the user and repeat the request to the API Platform to create an API proxy. The request will be successful, as the role 'development' does permit the user to create APIs.
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u justauser@apigee.com:secret -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -X POST -d'{"name" : "rbacTestApi"}'</pre>
	</div>
	<h4>Configure fine-grained access over a single API proxy</h4>
	You can configure role-based access over individual entities by creating them as RBAC resources. For example, the API proxy that the user created above is the <code>rbacTestApi</code>. You can create this API proxy as an RBAC resource with this request:
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/resources -H "Content-type:application/json" -X POST -d'{"displayName" : "rbacTestApi", "path" : "/applications/rbacTestApi"}'</pre>
	</div>
	<p>In the same way that you created permissions for classes of RBAC ressources, you create permissions for individual resources and provision those permissions to named roles. Permissions set for individual RBAC resources always override permissions for RBAC resource collections. If a user in a role that has GET and PUT permissions for APIs, but only GET permission for a specific API, then the permissions for the individual RBAC resource take precedence, and the user has only GET permissions on the specific API, regardless of permissions set for the RBAC resource colelction.</p>
	<h4>Get user roles for a user</h4>
	<p>As an organization admininstrator, you can check the list of user roles for a user at any time:</p>
	<div id="well">
		<pre>$ curl -u myname:mypass https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/users/justauser@apigee.com/userroles</pre>
	</div>
