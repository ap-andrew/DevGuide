<h2>What's here?</h2>
<p>The API Platform Developer Guide is designed to get you up and and running with local development of API proxies that deploy and scale on the Apigee API Platform. 
	
<p>The focus of development on the API Platform is the API proxy. An API proxy is an application that runs on the Apigee API Platform and which serves as a proxy for one or more backend services or APIs. Every API proxy exposes a new API that can be consumed by apps.</p>

<pre>For an overview of how the API Platform can help you as a developer, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3W6JSgGoO_o"><b>Watch the video</b></a>.</pre>

<p>Using API proxies, you can proxy any publicly available API, which makes the API Platform a great solution for developers who need to customize the behavior of APIs--whether the developer controls the API or not. Once you proxy an API with an API proxy, all of the enterprise capabilities of Apigee are at your disposal. You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Leverage a policy library to implement common behavior without writing any code</li>
	<li>Innovate on the API Platform by writing and deploying custom code in the Cloud</li>
	<li>Combine policies and custom code to create sophisticated yet easy-to-manage and secure applications</li>
	<li>Provision and manage API keys and OAuth authorization</li>
	<li>Monitor the operational performance of APIs</li>
	<li>Track and analyze consumption patterns by developers and apps</li>
	<li>Expose the capabilities that you implement as APIs, complete with an API Console, enabling re-use across projects or sharing with other developers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This Developer Guide provides instruction on local development of API proxies. You don't need to be an expert in any of these topics, but, when building API proxies, it's useful to have some familiarity with the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Representational State Transfer (REST)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript Object Notation</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">Extensible Markup Language</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema">XML Schema</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally:</p>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript and Python scripting languages</li>
	<li>Java programming language</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create API proxies in the <a href="enterprise.apigee.com">API Platform Management UI</a>. For instructions, refer to the the <a href="/docs/enterprise/content/user_guide">API Platform User Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>What you'll learn</h2>

<p>In this Developer Guide you will learn:</p>
<ul>

	<li>How to write scripts and code that execute as components of an API proxy</li>
	<li>How to implement common use cases required by API developers</li>
	<li>How to expose and reuse your policy compositions and code as APIs using WADL and API Consoles</li>
	<li>How to configure environment settings for your organization on the API Platform</li>
</ul>
