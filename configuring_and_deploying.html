<p>Apigee API facades are implemented in API proxies. An API Proxy is a bundle of configuration files (including policies) and (optionally) code. Apigee enables you develop API proxies locally and host them remotely on the Apigee API Platform, providing the flexibility to do advanced configuration and programming locally, using code editors and development tools. Over time, you can optimize your workflow locally and in the Management UI.</p>

<h2>Working with the Apigee python deploy tool</h2>

<p>To support local development of API facades, Apigee provides an open-source tool written in Python to help you simplify and manage the process of packaging and deploying APIs from your local machine to Apigee. (The [node:2047] provides information on complete set up information.)</p>

<p>Now you use Apigeeâ€™s Python tool to import (upload) and deploy your API in one simple process.</p>
<p>In the api-platform-samples package, the deploy tool, <code>deploy.py</code>, is available under <code>/tools</code></p>

<p>The command below imports an API proxy called 'weatherapi' to the 'test' environment in an organization specified in <code>myorg</code>.</p>
<p>Substitute a valid username, password, and Apigee API Platform organization for <code>myname:mypass</code> and <code>myorg</code>. (These are the credentials used to login in to your account on <a href="http://enterprise.apigee.com">enterprise.apigee.com</a>.)</p>

<p>A pointer must be provided to the directory that contains the <code>/apiproxy</code> directory, in this case <code>simpleProxy</code></p>
<p>For example, run:</p>
<pre>$ python tools/deploy.py -n weatherapi -u myname:mypass -o myorg -e test -p / -d simpleProxy</pre>

<p>This single action zips the API proxy configuration files, pushes them to to the specified organization on the API Platform, and deploys the API proxy  to the specified environment, in the following example, 'test'.</p>

<p>On success the result is:</p>
<pre>Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/weatherapi.xml to apiproxy/weatherapi.xml
Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml to apiproxy/proxies/default.xml
Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/targets/default.xml to apiproxy/targets/default.xml
Imported new proxy version 1
Environment: test
  Revision: 1 BasePath = /
  State: deployed</pre>

<p>The tool has zipped up the API proxy configuration, imported the package to the API Platform, and deployed to the test environment.</p>

<p>At this point, the API facade can be invoked by client apps.</p>

<h2><a class="jumplink" name="submit"></a>Invoke an API facade</h2>

<p>The proxied URL for an API is defined by the environment where the API proxy is deployed. The proxied URL consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organization name: </li>
	<li>The environment name: </li>
	<li>The Apigee facade base URL (<code>apigee.net</code>, NOT <code>api.enterprise.apigee.com</code>)</li>
	<li>The base path URI fragment you configure for the API proxy (in the example above, <code>/weather</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The URL for the API facade in this example is:</p>

<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather</pre>

<p>For an organization called 'apifactory', the API facade address is:</p>

<pre>http://apifactory-test.apigee.net/weather</pre>

<p>To invoke an API facade, clients submit requests to:</p>

<pre>$ curl http://{org_name}-{env_name}.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>

<p>The API Platform takes the URI path following the base path (as defined in the ProxyEndpoint) and appends the value to the URL defined in the HTTPConnection for the TargetEndpoint. The result would be an outbound call to:</p>

<div id="well"><pre>http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre></div>

<p>The API Platform receives the response and returns the response to the client app.</p>
