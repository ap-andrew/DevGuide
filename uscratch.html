<ul><li>Pre-computed, static dimensions used for operational dashboards</li>
<li>Dynamic dimensions, whose metrics are computed 'on-demand' when a report is built</li>
<li>Custom dimensions, which enable you to build reports based on message content</li></ul>

<p>For each type of dimension, you construct a request by adding the desired dimension by name as a URI parameter following <code>/stats</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>/stats/apis</pre>

<pre>/stats/apps</pre>

<p>You define the report by specifying a set or query parameters that define the desired metrics, calculation, time range, and filters.</p>

<p>For pre-computed metrics, only simple calculations are needed, since the specific function used to perform the calculation is embedded in the metric.</p>

<p>To generate custom reports, you select a <code>metric + function</code> calculation to run over the specified dimensions.</p>

<p>The base request to create a custom report that calculates average response time for all APIs in an environment is:</p>

<pre>/stats/apis?select=avg(total_response_time)</pre>

<p>Use the additional query parameters defined in the API method to construct the complete request.</p>
