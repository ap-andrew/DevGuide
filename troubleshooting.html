<p>This section provides solutions to common errors that you may see while working with the API Platform.</p>
<p>If you have other issues, please post them to the <a href="http://support.apigee.com/support">Developer Forum</a>.</p>
<h2>HTTP Errors</h2>
<p><strong>HTTP 403:</strong> This an authorization failure. It means that the username and password combination you are using is not valid for the organization you specified. To test your credentials, login to <a href="http://enterprise.apigee.com/login">enterprise.apigee.com/login</a>. Once logged in check your account settings to see the organization name. In some situations, you may belong to multiple organizations. Make sure that you are using the correct credentials for you organization. Check your spelling. &nbsp;If you need an account, sign up here:&nbsp;<a href="http://enterprise.apigee.com/trial">http://enterprise.apigee.com/trial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP 404: </strong>The object wasn't found. This is usually happens because of misspelling in your request URL, but it may also happen if you try to update an object that doesn't exist (for example, the wrong revision of an API).</p>
<h2>CLASSIFICATION_FAILURE</h2>
<p>You may see this error when you submit a request to your API proxy after you deploy it to the Apigee platform. This error means that Apigee cannot determine which API proxy your request should be routed to. This usually happens because your request URL does not match the base path for any API proxies currently deployed in the environment. (Note that Apigee validates that all base paths are unique when a new API proxy is imported.)&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Verify the URI for your API by logging in to the Apigee UI at <a href="http://enterprise.apigee.com">enterprise.apigee.com</a>. Select the link to your API. At the top of the page, the URI for you API including the base path, displays at the top of the page.</li>
	<li>Make sure your API proxy is deployed. Your API proxy may be imported to Apigee, but may not be deployed to an environment. API proxies can only be invoked after they have been successfully deployed to an environment. (Note that the deploy tool used in this quick start both imports and deploys your API proxy to the environment you specify.)</li>
	<li>Make sure your request is being sent to the correct environment:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace; ">http://{myorg}-test.apigee.net/weather</span>&nbsp;versus&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace; ">http://{myorg}-prod.apigee.net/weather</span>, for example.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internal Classification Error</h2>

<p>When working with resources (such as JavaScript), you may see the folllowing error:</p>

<div id="class"><pre>{"fault":{"faultstring":"Missing API proxy for Organization:myorg;Environment:test;VirtualHost:default;Application:weatherapi;Revision:26;APIProxy:default ","detail":{"errorcode":"messaging.runtime.InternalClassificationError"}}}</pre></div>

<p>This error is caused by naming issues in the configuration for a policy that references a resource (for example, a JavaScript policy that references a JavaScript resource.) The file name of the resource (for example <code>my_javascript_js</code>) must be an exact match of the name you provide in the policy reference. 
</p>

<h2>Deploy Tool Errors</h2>
<div><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">python: can't open file 'tools/deploy.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory</span>: &nbsp;</div>
<div>The path you have provided to <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">deploy.py</span> is incorrect.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<p>If you see the following result on import, it indicates that you are running the deploy tool from the wring directory.&nbsp;</p>
	<pre>Import failed to /v1/organizations/myorg/apis?action=import&amp;name=weatherapi with status 500:
{
  "code" : "messaging.config.beans.ImportFailed",
  "message" : "Failed to import the bundle : java.util.zip.ZipException: ZIP file must have at least one entry",
  "contexts" : [ ]
}</pre>
</div>
<div>To fix this issue, run <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">deploy.py</span>&nbsp;from the base directory of the API platform samples distribution. In the deploy tool command, specify the directory that <em>contains</em> the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">./apiproxy</span> directory-- in this package that value is <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">simpleProxy</span>.</div>
