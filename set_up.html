<p>This topic helps you get set up with the prerequisites you need to build API proxies locally.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Sign up for an Apigee Enterprise account</h2>

<p>The Apigee API Platform enables any developer to leverage the enterprise-strength capabilities of Apigee Enterprise. Apigee provides free accounts that give you access to all of the features available to enterprise customers. You can sign up for a free account at <a href="https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up">https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up</a>.</p>
<p>An Apigee API Platform account provides you with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An organization</li>
	<li>A username</li>
	<li>A password</li>
</ul>
<p>You use these credentials to login to <a href="http://enterprise.apigee.com">enterprise.apigee.com</a> and to access the RESTful API exposed by the Apigee API Platform. If you need an account in an existing organization, please contact your organization administrator.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Download sample API proxies, policies, and code</h2>


<div class="sample-github"><p>The developer topics refer to a set of API Platform samples that are located on Github.</p>

<p>For detail see [node:4561]</p></div>

<p>To obtain the sample files, run:</p>

	<pre class="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples.git</pre>

<p>If you do not have Git installed, please refer to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">Github's git setup instructions</a>. If you don't want to install Git, you can browse the files and download a ZIP from <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples">https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples</a>.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is required to run the Apigee deploy tool. Python is present in most Linux environments, on a Mac with XCode installed, on a Windows machine with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> installed, and in many other places.</p>
<p>To obtain Python, please refer to the <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/">Python installation instructions</a>.</p>
<h3>An HTTP Client</h3>
<p>The Developer Guide provides sample HTTP requests using cURL. If you need cURL, you can download it from http://curl.haxx.se.</p>
<p>Note: If you are running Windows, makes sure to download a version of curl that includes the libcurl library.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Run sample cURL commands</h2>

<p>The goal of each topic is to enable you to interact with the RESTful API by cutting and pasting simple cURL commands directly into your command-line terminal.</p>

<p>After you cut and paste the command to your terminal, you must replace the following variables in the command with information for your Apigee account:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>myname</code>: The username for your Apigee account</li>
	<li><code>mypass</code>: The password for your account in an Apigee account</li>
	<li><code>myorg</code>: The name of your organization</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b>Specific values within responses my differ given the differences in username, time values, etc.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>On Windows, you may need to use a flag to disable the trust check that cURL performs against the SSL certificate presented by the API Platform. You can do this by adding <code>-k</code> to each request you submit via cURL on the command line. This only disables the trust check and does not disable encryption.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -k https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u myname:mypass</pre>

<p>If you are using the API Platform samples, set the values for your organization, username, and password in the file <code>/setup/setenv.sh</code>. Once you have done so, you can run the simplified deploy and invoke scripts provided for each sample API proxy.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Make a successful API call to the API Platform</h2>

<p>In this step, you make an API call to the Apigee API Platform. The API call in this example returns a list of the names of all API proxies in your organization.</p>

<p>First, open the terminal on your computer.</p>

<p>Copy and paste the following command into the terminal window on your computer.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/{org_name}/apis -u myname:mypass</pre>

<p>For brevity, you can abbreviate <code>/organizations</code> as <code>/o</code>:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -u myname:mypass</pre>

<p>For example, if your username is <code>me@mycompany.com</code>, your password is <code>secret</code>, and your account in the organization called <code>apifactory</code>, then the request looks like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/apifactory/apis -u me@mycompany.com:secret</pre>

<p>The request and response should look like this in your terminal:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/apifactory/apis -u myname:mypass
[ ]</pre>

<p>Not much of a response! What you see is an empty JSON array. The array is empty because you have not created any API proxies yet. If you do see a list of names, it's because some API proxies have already been created or imported. In the next topic, [node:429], you use the API to create, deploy and invoke an API proxy. </p>

<p>curl has a few tools that can make you life easier. For example, you often need to see the HTTP headers associated with a request. To obtain this detail about an HTTP request, you can use the <code>-v</code> flag provided by curl. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -u myname:mypass -v</pre>

<p>If you only want to see the HTTP headers on the response from the API Platform (and not the content), then you can use the <code>-I</code> flag.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl  https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{org_name}/apis -u myname:mypass -I</pre>

<h2>Working with XML</h2>

<p>JSON is the default format for response messages, but XML is supported equally.</p>

<p>If you require XML, you can add an HTTP <code>Accept</code> header to get an XML response instead of JSON:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -H "Accept:text/xml" \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis -u me@mycompany.com:secret</pre>

<p>When POSTing or PUTting payloads in XML, use the <code>Content-type</code> HTTP header:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ curl -H "Content-type:text/xml" -X POST -d \
'&lt;XMLPayload&gt;
 &lt;/XMLPayload&gt; ' \
https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/organizations/apifactory/apis \
-u me@mycompany.com:secret</pre>

<p>For troubleshooting tips, see [node:4536].</p>

<p>If you have any issues with the topic, post them to the at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apigee.com">Apigee Developer Forum</a>.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Now you have successfully invoked the RESTful API exposed by the API Platform.</p>

<p>In the next Developer Guide topic, [node:429], you deploy and invoke a working API proxy.</p>
