<p>This topic demonstrates authoring, storing, and attaching policies to modify the behavior of an API facade.</p>

<p>The Apigee API Platform defines a set of out-of-the-box policies. A policy is a configuration file that encapsulates an atomic unit of common management functionality. The purpose of policies is to provide advanced management capabilities without requiring developers to write and maintain code. Policies are designed to be easily understood and reusable. Policies can be combined into policy compositions to enable sophisticated, yet easily managed and maintained, API behavior. Policies and compositions can also be augmented with custom scripts and code, enabling developers to delegate mundane tasks to policies, while focusing creative development effort on implementing custom logic, in turn using the API platform as a cloud deployment environment in which to expose, manage, and scale custom API behavior.</p>

<p>Concretely, a policy is an XML-formatted configuration file that conforms to the API Platform XML schema. Each policy type has an associated XML schema that specifies the necessary configuration. Policy schemas are available in the <a href="https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/">API Platform samples</a> on Github.</p>

<p>A complete list of out-of-the-box policies is documented in the <a href="/docs/enterprise/content/customize-apis">API Platform Policy Reference</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a policy</h2>
	
<p>This topic uses the Quota policy type as an example of how to create, configure, attach, and deploy policies. Quota policies are very common, as they provide settings that control how often a client app is permitted to invoke an API over a given time interval. In the example below, a quota policy is configured to limit apps to 1 request per minute. (While this may not be realistic, it does provide a simple way to see the effects of a policy.)</p>
<p>Policy files are stored as XML files under <code>/apiproxy/policies</code> directory.</p>
<p>For example, a policy of type Quota called "QuotaPolicy" could be created as a file called <code>QuotaPolicy.xml</code> with the following content:</p>

<pre>&lt;Quota enabled="true" continueOnError="false"
async="false" name="QuotaPolicy"&gt;
    &lt;Allow count="1"/&gt;
    &lt;Interval&gt;1&lt;/Interval&gt;
    &lt;TimeUnit&gt;minute&lt;/TimeUnit&gt;
&lt;/Quota&gt;</pre>

<p>All policies have some settings that are specific to the policy type, and some settings that are generic across all policies.</p>

<p>All policies define the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>enabled</code>: Indicates whether the policy is turned "on" or "off". Policies can be enabled/disabled at runtime by changing this setting. A policy that has <code>enabled</code> set to <code>false</code> is not enforced. </li>
	<li><code>continueOnError</code>: Defines whether the pipeline should continue processing the message if the policy fails. When enforcing quota policies, errors likely indicate that the quota has been exceeded, and, therefore, this attribute should be set to false.</li>
	<li><code>async</code>: If set to <code>true</code> the processing pipeline will continue processing subsequent policy steps before the current step completes. Asynchronous setting is useful, for example, when using policies to call out to external APIs or services as part of a flow.</li>
	<li><code>name</code>: The name that you give to this policy. This name is unique to this policy instance, and it is used to attach the policy to the flow as a processing step.</li>
</ul>
<p>The elements <code>Allow</code>, <code>Interval</code>, and <code>TimeUnit</code> are specific to the quota policy. These elements provide settings that the API Platform enforces on behalf of an API. Other policy types define their own settings.</p>

<h2>Attaching a policy to a ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint flow</h2>
<p>Policies in the <code>/policies</code> directory are available to be executed in the processing pipeline of a ProxyEndpoint or a TargetEndpoint. Policies are executed as processing steps in a request flow or response flow. To specify the point in the flow at which a policy executes, the policy is attached to a ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint flow as a processing step.</p>

<p>The format of a policy attachment is:</p>

<pre>&lt;Step&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;{policy_name}&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/Step&gt;</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;Step&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;QuotaPolicy&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/Step&gt;</pre>

<p>A policy is attached to a flow by adding the step configuration to the appropriate request or response flow in a ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint. For example, a quota must be enforced before any additional processing occurs. Therefore, a quota policy should be attached to the ProxyEndpoint request PreFlow.</p>
	
<p>For example, the following basic ProxyEndpoint configuration has no policy attachments:</p>

<pre>&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
    &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
        &lt;BasePath&gt;/weather&lt;/BasePath&gt;
        &lt;VirtualHost&gt;default&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
    &lt;/HTTPProxyConnection&gt;
  &lt;RouteRule name="default"&gt;
     &lt;TargetEndpoint&gt;default&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt;
  &lt;/RouteRule&gt;
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;</pre>

<p>A quota policy can be attached as a processing step to the ProxyEndpoint request PreFlow as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;ProxyEndpoint name="default"&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;PreFlow&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Request&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Step&gt;&lt;Name&gt;QuotaPolicy&lt;/Name&gt;&lt;/Step&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/Request&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;/PreFlow&gt;
  &lt;HTTPProxyConnection&gt; 
    &lt;BasePath&gt;/weather&lt;/BasePath&gt; 
    &lt;VirtualHost&gt;default&lt;/VirtualHost&gt; 
  &lt;/HTTPProxyConnection&gt; 
  &lt;RouteRule name="default"&gt; 
    &lt;TargetEndpoint&gt;default&lt;/TargetEndpoint&gt; 
  &lt;/RouteRule&gt; 
&lt;/ProxyEndpoint&gt;</pre>

<p>In the ProxyEndpoint configuration above, the quota policy executes when the ProxyEndpoint receives a request from a client app, and before any additional processing takes place.</p>

<h2><a class="jumplink" name="import_deploy"></a>Importing and deploying changes</h2>
<p>Whenever an API proxy is modified, the changes must be imported to an organization on the API platform and then deployed into an environment. Policy changes do not take effect until the modified configuration files have been imported and deployed.</p>

<p>From the base directory of <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">api-platform-samples</span>, run the Python deploy tool, substituting your username and password for <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">myname:mypass</span> and your Apigee organization for <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">myorg</span>.</p>
<pre>$ python tools/deploy.py -n weatherapi -u myname:mypass -o myorg -e test -p / -d simpleProxy</pre>
<p>You should see the following result:</p>
<pre>Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/weatherapi.xml to apiproxy/weatherapi.xml
Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/policies/QuotaPolicy.xml to apiproxy/policies/QuotaPolicy.xml
Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml to apiproxy/proxies/default.xml
Writing ./simpleProxy/apiproxy/targets/default.xml to apiproxy/targets/default.xml
Imported new proxy version 2
Undeploying revision 1 in same environment and path:
Environment: test
  Revision: 2 BasePath = /
  State: deployed</pre>
<p>Note that the deploy tool deploys a new revision number, and provides a notice indicating that the previous revision has been undeployed. If necessary, the revision mechanism can be used to revert to the previous revision of the API proxy, thus rolling back any changes. The Apigee deploy tool always increments the revision number of an API facade on import.</p>

<h2><a class="jumplink" name="verify_quota_policy"></a>Verifying policy enforcement</h2>
<p>To verify that a policy is enforced properly, the API must be invoked by an HTTP client. Submit multiple request to the API, exceeding the quota limit that you set in the quota policy. (The URI path, configured as the base path setting in the ProxyEndpoint, in the request below is <code>/weather</code>). </p>
<pre>http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/weather/forecastrss?w=12797282</pre>
<p>After you submit more than 1 request within a minute:</p>
<pre>{"fault":{"faultstring":"policies.ratelimit.QuotaViolation","detail":{"errorcode":"policies.ratelimit.QuotaViolation"}}}</pre>
<p>Now that you understand how to create and attach a simple quota policy, you can begin working locally with all of the policies that are provided by Apigee.</p>
<h2>Configuring conditional policy enforcement</h2>
<p>A powerful feature of the API Platform is conditional policy enforcement.</p>
<p>Conditional statements can be added to policy attachments. For example, to add a conditional statement that enforces a quota policy only for XML messages:</p>
<div id="class"><pre>&lt;Step&gt;
  &lt;Condition&gt;request.header.content-type = "text/xml"&lt;/Condition&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;QuotaPolicy&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/Step&gt;</pre></div>
<p>Conditions have two components, a <i>variable</i> and a <i>conditional operator</i>.</p>
<p>The configuration above uses a variable defined by Apigee: <code>request.header.content-type</code></p>.
<p>It evaluates the <code>content-type</code> header in the request message from the client, and checks to see whether that value equals <code>text/xml</code>. If the condition evaluates to true, the policy is enforced. If not, the policy is bypassed.</p>
